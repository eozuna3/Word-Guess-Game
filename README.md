# Word-Guess-Game


This was one of my homework assignements that specifically utilized JavaScript in order to create a version of a Star Wars themed Hangman Game. This assignment is an intital introduction into the world of using Javascript and provided my as the programmer first hand experience with using Javascript and allowing my webpages to interact with the user.

When game initially loads the user is give the choice of playing a game by pressing any letter or creating a new game by pressing space bar.  The game continues until the user correctly guesses the name of the Stars Wars character before he runs out of guesses or until he runs out of guesses.  The game will only allow him to use lower case letters, and it make sure he does not lose a guess if he accidentially hits a letter he has already tried.  Also it does not allow them to continue guessing letters if they lost or won without starting a new game entirely.  

It utilizes several javascript functions for making the game function properly. I also added some graphics and sound effects for when the player lost and won to make it a more enjoyable experience for the player.
